			<h1>My Autobiography</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					My name is Angus Wong. I was born on the 17th of November, 2000. I live in a family of four, with my parents and my little brother who is two years younger than me. My family has great enthusiasm on doing backpacking trips, so we usually go abroad for a month or so to do some traveling by ourselves every summer vacation. I really enjoy visiting new places and wondering through the trails of countryside villages especially in the UK and Scotland.</br></br>

					My early life was mostly studying and music. After studying, I'll spend most of my spare time listening to music and practicing the piano. Classical music is my favorite type of music. I am very fond of the variation and the thickness of classical music. No offensive, but I do think that modern pop music does not have the intensity of most classical music. Jazz and 20s swings are also my type of music. Both of them has strong but flexible tempo, which gives me a relaxing mood. These musics are also the kind I'll be listening to when I am studying. Before I went to the university, I always enjoy playing piano. My favorite composer is Beethoven, for his work has such depth and dramatic change; but I prefer playing Chopin most of the time, as Beethoven requires more technique and concentration, Chopin is more relaxing and allows more flexibility for me throughout the music.</br></br>

					After I was graduated from the primary school, I found out that I am really interested on computer hardware and baking snacks, so I spend a lot of time learning these knowledges by my own, and realize that what I am interested in is the process of making the actual things out. I found out that I enjoy the most during the process of making snacks and building the whole computer bottom up. This makes a lot of sense to me since these two activities requires some uncommon knowledge and some skills. Probably the biggest difference is that I have more opportunities on making snacks than having enough budget to build another new computer. After I went into the university, the only two hobby I can still retain is listening to the music and baking snacks. Though I can still play some music when I go back home on holiday, but it is not as frequent as before. I am still really interested on computer hardware, and is considering to turn this hobby into my minor in the university.</br></br>

				我的名字是翁子雲，出生於西元2000年11月17號。我的家庭成員包含我有四人：包含我的父母親和比我小兩歲多的弟弟。我們家很喜歡出國旅行，所以每年總會抽空出國個一兩個月。出國一定是自由行，因為自由行可以更自由的調配行程和時間。出國玩的時候我們不會窩在城市大街上頭，反而常往鄉下或者小巷子裡鑽，相信我，小巷子裡往往可以找到出乎意料的有趣玩意兒。</br>
				我在上大學前的生活跟音樂幾乎是黏在一起。唸完書後很喜歡練琴或者聽音樂來打發時間。除了練琴，我還會一點點薩克斯風，只不過比起鋼琴就遜色得多了。我聽的音樂類型很不像是現代的年輕人，爵士樂、古典樂、或者80年以前的西洋流行樂都是我的首選，反倒是中文歌和台語歌我一竅不通，常常甚至連歌手我都沒聽過。我的這些音樂相關興趣多半受到我父親影響，從小聽到大，漸漸的我也喜歡上了這些趣味豐饒的歌曲。相同的，我彈鋼琴也只演奏古典樂。我比較喜歡演奏蕭邦，因為他寫的曲子允許演奏者放入自身情感，不必完全照著譜來演奏。貝多芬、莫札特、和小約翰史特勞斯等等的曲目也是演奏起來很好玩而且很耐聽的作曲家，但是他們時代更久、更傳統，不太允許演奏者放入自身情感（所謂隨興演奏），所以我有時會避而遠之。</br>
				我從國中畢業以後，我同時又發展出了電腦相關的興趣，而且尤其是電腦硬體的興趣。我發現我不僅僅喜歡研究各個零件之間的性能差異，我也很喜歡研究這些零件背後的運作原理。但是我最喜歡組裝電腦的過程。這項發現是在我高中第一次擁有自己的電腦，而且在自己組裝時發現的。這同時和我休閒時也很喜歡做甜點的興趣有點接近－都是需要動手做的事情。只是做餅乾可能只要花幾百塊，但是組電腦往往動輒幾萬塊，這項興趣如果不是業內或者收入豐厚，還真是挺不容易維持的。</br>
				現在我上了大學，我沒法像以前一樣整天練琴了和做點心了，但是我假日回家時依舊可以抽空摸摸這些興趣。相較電腦資訊在大學裡似乎是可以觸碰的到的，我正在研究是否可以到資工系選修雙專長或者輔修。</br></br></br>

				I haven't add the two white box at the top and the bottom of the webpage yet. Maybe next week.
