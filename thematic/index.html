					<h1>A Guide For Your Very First Desktop Computer.</h1>
					<p>Building a computer is a very interesting thing to do. It is very much like decorating your own room, you have complete control with your choices. Everyone can build with their unique taste. In this website, we will go through the basic concepts of building your own computer with suitable components.</p>

					<h2>Laptops? Why Not Build a Desktop?</h2>

							<p class="text_style">A desktop can usually provide much more performance than your laptop. A laptop's design has to take its weight and durability into consideration, whereas a desktop doesn't. Such as a laptop cannot use too much power, or else the battery will die too soon. This will force the laptop to compromise with its performance. That means there will be better performance on a desktop than a laptop. More perfomrance? Why Not?</p>

						<div class="column_box">

							<p class="text_style">All in all, it would be cheaper to have a desktop than a laptop. Almost any components in a desktop can be easily replaced or upgraded. This is because there are a global standard of every plugs and attachments in a desktop. What this means is that you can replace any damaged componenets in a desktop with no difficulty comparing with laptops that are usually required to be sent back to the factory.</p>

						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="005.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">You can pick every components of a desktop by yourself, instead of pre-decided by the manufacturer. You want a small case? Shure. A gigantic case? Not a problem. You want it pink? Or you want some flashy LED? As you wanted. You can even have a huge 40" 8K display attached to it. A desktop has such flexibility on everything that it completely crushes the laptop, which comes in limited design and specs.</p>

					<h1>Should You Build a Desktop?<br>Or Simply Get a Laptop?</h1>
					<p>When it is called a desktop, it means that it cannot be moved easily. If you need your computer, but you moves around a lot, a laptop is more suitable for you. Other than this, it is probably always better to build a desktop than buying another new laptop from both durability and performance perspective.</p>

					<h1>CPU. The Heart of a Computer</h1>
					<p>CPU, also known as Central Processing Unit, is the most important part of a computer. It is the brain of a computer. Before you choose you CPU, you have to decide the purpose of your computer first. In general, better CPU have more computing "cores" and therefore runs faster. But better CPU means that it is more expensive. If you only do simple paper work and surfing online, you probably shouldn't need a strong CPU. On the other hand, if you plays a lot of video games or you are a creator such as annimatior or video editor, you might need a good CPU to keep up with the heavy load program you are using.</p>

					<h2>Two Companies That Produces CPU.</h2>
					<div class="column_container">
						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="intel.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">Intel produces reliable consumer CPUs. Currently it has i3, i5, i7, and i9 line ups in its mainstream products. i3 as its low-end processors, to i9 for its extreme users. To distinguish between these 4 series, the more complex of your computer's tasks are, the better you choose. To recommend, i5 cores are fair in price and performance, giving us 6 cores and 12 threads with good price. i3 only comes with 4 cores and 8 threads, and its low power consumption design means that the performance will be quite poor. Currently in 2020 and 2021, we are seeing Intel's 11th gen and 12th gen cores on the market. It is mainly targeting on complex 3d video games.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="amd.png"></img>
							<p class="text_style">AMD is well known by people as the company that produces "cheap and good" CPUs. The company is well known for producing CPUs with a lot cores such as 8 cores to 16 cores, or even 32 cores. Unfortunately, the core numbers of CPU cannot be compared between two companies since two compnay had completely different designs on their processors. AMD provides us its Ryzen-3, Ryzen-5, Ryzen-7, and Ryzen-9 series in its mainstream products. Just like Intel, Ryzen-5 is most well balanced between performance and price. In average, AMD gives magnificant performance on mainly advanced productive programs such as video editing and 3d modeling.</p>
