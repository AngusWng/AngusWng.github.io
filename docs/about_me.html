								My name is Angus Wong. I was born on the 17th of November, 2000. I live in a family of four, with my parents and my little brother who is two years younger than me. My family has great enthusiasm on doing backpacking trips, so we usually go abroad for a month or so to do some traveling by ourselves every summer vacation. I really enjoy visiting new places and wondering through the trails of countryside villages especially in the UK and Scotland.</br></br>

								My early life was mostly studying and music. After studying, I'll spend most of my spare time listening to music and practicing the piano. Classical music is my favorite type of music. I am very fond of the variation and the thickness of classical music. No offensive, but I do think that modern pop music does not have the intensity of most classical music. Jazz and 20s swings are also my type of music. Both of them has strong but flexible tempo, which gives me a relaxing mood. These musics are also the kind I'll be listening to when I am studying. Before I went to the university, I always enjoy playing piano. My favorite composer is Beethoven, for his work has such depth and dramatic change; but I prefer playing Chopin most of the time, as Beethoven requires more technique and concentration, Chopin is more relaxing and allows more flexibility for me throughout the music.</br></br>

								After I was graduated from the primary school, I found out that I am really interested on computer hardware and baking snacks, so I spend a lot of time learning these knowledges by my own, and realize that what I am interested in is the process of making the actual things out. I found out that I enjoy the most during the process of making snacks and building the whole computer bottom up. This makes a lot of sense to me since these two activities requires some uncommon knowledge and some skills. Probably the biggest difference is that I have more opportunities on making snacks than having enough budget to build another new computer. After I went into the university, the only two hobby I can still retain is listening to the music and baking snacks. Though I can still play some music when I go back home on holiday, but it is not as frequent as before. I am still really interested on computer hardware, and is considering to turn this hobby into my minor in the university.</br></br>
