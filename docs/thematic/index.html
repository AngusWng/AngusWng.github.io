					<h1>A Guide For Your Very First Desktop Computer.</h1>
					<p>Building a computer is a very interesting thing to do. It is very much like decorating your own room, you have complete control with your choices. Everyone can build with their unique taste. In this website, we will go through the basic concepts of building your own computer with suitable components.</p>
					<p>To be warned: prepare your wallets!</p>

					<h2>Laptops? Why Not Build a Desktop?</h2>

							<p class="text_style">A desktop can usually provide much more performance than your laptop. A laptop's design has to take its weight and durability into consideration, whereas a desktop doesn't. Such as a laptop cannot use too much power, or else the battery will die too soon. This will force the laptop to compromise with its performance. That means there will be better performance on a desktop than a laptop. More perfomrance? Why Not?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="004.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">All in all, it would be cheaper to have a desktop than a laptop. Almost any components in a desktop can be easily replaced or upgraded. This is because there are global standards in every plugs and attachments in a desktop. What this means is that you can replace any damaged componenets in a desktop with any other third party company parts, comparing with laptops that are usually required to be sent back to the factory.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="005.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">You can pick every components of a desktop by yourself, instead of pre-decided by the manufacturer. You want a small case? Shure. A gigantic case? Not a problem. You want it pink? Or you want some flashy LED? As you wanted. You can even have a huge 40" 8K display attached to it. A desktop has such flexibility on everything that it completely crushes the laptop, which comes in limited design and specs.</p>

					<h1>Should You Build a Desktop?<br>Or Simply Get a Laptop?</h1>
					<p>When it is called a desktop, it means that it cannot be moved easily. If you need your computer, but you moves around a lot, a laptop is more suitable for you. Other than this, it is probably always better to build a desktop than buying another new laptop from both durability and performance perspective.</p>

					<h1>CPU. The Heart of a Computer</h1>
					<p>CPU, also known as Central Processing Unit, is the most important part of a computer. It is the brain of a computer. Before you choose you CPU, you have to decide the purpose of your computer first. In general, better CPU have more computing "cores" and therefore runs faster. But better CPU means that it is more expensive. If you only do simple paper work and surfing online, you probably shouldn't need a strong CPU. On the other hand, if you plays a lot of video games or you are a creator such as annimatior or video editor, you might need a good CPU to keep up with the heavy load program you are using.</p>

					<h2>Two Companies That Produces CPU.</h2>
					<div class="column_container">
						<div class="column_box" style="margin-left: 0;">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="intel.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">Intel produces reliable consumer CPUs. Currently it has i3, i5, i7, and i9 line ups in its mainstream products. i3 as its low-end processors, to i9 for its extreme users. To distinguish between these 4 series, the more complex of your computer's tasks are, the better you choose. To recommend, i5 cores are fair in price and performance, giving us 6 cores and 12 threads with good price. i3 only comes with 4 cores and 8 threads, and its low power consumption design means that the performance will be quite poor. Currently in 2020 and 2021, we are seeing Intel's 11th gen and 12th gen cores on the market. It is mainly targeting on complex 3d video games.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="amd.png"></img>
							<p class="text_style">AMD is well known by people as the company that produces "cheap and good" CPUs. The company is well known for producing CPUs with a lot cores such as 8 cores to 16 cores, or even 32 cores. Unfortunately, the core numbers of CPU cannot be compared between two companies since two compnay had completely different designs on their processors. AMD provides us its Ryzen-3, Ryzen-5, Ryzen-7, and Ryzen-9 series in its mainstream products. Just like Intel, Ryzen-5 is most well balanced between performance and price. In average, AMD gives magnificant performance on mainly advanced productive programs such as video editing and 3d modeling.</p>

					<h1>Motherboard &<br>RAM (Read Only Memory)</h1>
					<p>Motherboard is where all of the components connects to. The only two biggest thing to be careful is to choose the correct motherboard that fits your CPU, and the size of the board is good for you. There are 4 main sizes of motherboards, from biggest to smallest are: E-ATX(XL), ATX(L), M-ATX(M), and ITX(S).</p>
					<p>For most of the people, RAM doesn't do too much from your computer's performance, so if yer are in the mood, choose the one you think is good for you! Either it is cheap, or it looks shiny with its gorgreous RGB lightings.</p>

					<h2>GPU - All About Gaming.</h2>
					<p class="text_style">There are two maing companies that produces GPUs. Graphic Processing Unit, known as GPU, processes most of your visual effects on your computer. Fun fact, you can actually build a computer witouth a GPU, just all of the graphics will be processed by CPU, and CPU is not really effeicient on processing graphics. So to make it simple, if you want to play computer games, buy a GPU! Two basic things to be cautious when choosing your GPU is its brand and its graphics memory size. If you are enjoying your video games with a 2K or 4K resolution screen, make sure your graphics card's memory has more than 8 gigabytes of memory.</p>
					<div class="column_container">
						<div class="column_box" style="margin-left: 0;">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="rtx30.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">The most recent GPU from team green are its RTX-30 series. It has stable drivers and can produce beautiful lighting effects by emulating the trace of the light with their Ray Tracing technology. Though it is the more expensive choice.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="rx6000.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">AMD also sells GPUs. Its RX-6000 series us many more cheaper but also good options. Comparing with Nvidia, it is well more able to afford, but AMD has a bad reputation on its graphics drivers, the performance usually unstable or worse than competitors. </p>

					<h1>Storage - Capacity or Speed?</h1>
					<p>There are two types of storage for your computer: HDD and SSD. HDD has much bigger storage space with lower price. SSD has a faster speed of reading the data, giving you shorter waiting time when running games or copying files, but it can cost up to twice or more times more expensive than HDD under same size. On the contrary, SSD provides nearly three to five times faster on reading any data on your computer. Due to these reasons, it would also be a good strategy to buy a small capacity SSD for games and operating system, and a big capaciy HDD for any other data such as photos and music.</p>

					<h2>Power Supply and Chassis</h2>
					<div class="column_container">
						<div class="column_box" style="margin-left: 0;">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="power.jpg"></img>
							<p class="text_style">There's no big difference between power supply. Just keep in mind to keep a margin between the highest possible power consumption of your hardware and the wattage given by your power supply. The margin left will keep the power supply works under a safe and stable state all the time. For example, if your computer eats 500 watts maxium, you may choose a 650 watts power supply to make shure it won't overdrive itself and caught fire (it literally will burn).</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column_box">
							<img class="three_column_p" src="NZXT.png"></img>
							<p class="text_style">When choosing the chassis, two things to reminder. Apart from how beautiful your chassis is, make sure ALL COMPONENTS CAN FITS INTO YOUR CHASSIS. Some chassis can only fits smaller motherboards or shorter GPUs, as these two components are often the largest parts in all of the computer hardware. Some chassis, as the photo shows,a has a tempered glass side, you might want to tidy your wires up to make the view into your chassis nice and clean.</p>

					<h1>Don't Forget the Thermals.</h1>
					<p>Thermals are for cooling the hottest components in your computer, usually CPUs. There are two approach to cool your CPU down: air cooling and water cooling. Air cooling is basically a metal chunk stick with CPU. When air flows through, the heat is carried away.</p>
					<p>Water cooling needs some tubing. As the photo shows, Instead of a big metal attachment, only a small piece of metal is attached to the cpu. The cooling liquid then took the head away, the hot liquid then travels to the raidator by the tubing, and then the liquid be cooled down by air.</p>
					<p>Comparing with air and water cooling, air cooling requires deeper chassis, but it is very cheap and stable. Water cooling provides the best cooling results, but it costs alot and the liquid may evaporate or leak over several years of usage. Most enthusiasts like water cooling more than air cooling because they can DIY their liquid tubing, with some LED's the chassis will looks shiny and gorgeous. My recommendation is air cooling, as it is cheaper and lasts longer, with similar cooling ability comparing with water cooling.</p>

					<h2>Some Final Words.</h2>
					<p class="text_style">Until now, we had go through most of the main components inside a computer. The most entertaining part of building a computer is that we have so many choices but so little budget. Building an astonishing computer of your own with limited budget is the main goal of this article. Though we didn't go through the building procedure of a computer, but I think there are many article with insight and deep touturial on how to build a computer in a proper way. With these said, I hope you can build a computer you satisfied.</p>
